// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

const dadYearsOld = 48
const sonYearsOld = 7

    return Math.abs(sonYearsOld * 2 - dadYearsOld)
}
